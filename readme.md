## Goals

- Build a database of rodent inspection and treatment in D.C. 
- Produce a heat map, using some opensource map library
- Integrate tools to take screenshots, track past events and hold authorities accountable. 

## Description 

This project makes use of DC's Rodent Inspection and Treatment in Last 30 Days dataset, which can be found here: https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/rodent-inspection-and-treatment-in-last-30-days. 

It creates a map in R (https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html) and assigns points to geospatial coordinates in the earlier saved datasets. 

Once a month, someone needs to pull the data, update the database and ensure the visuals are updated. 

## Measuring_Progress

To measure progress, we should track: 
- Site visits and traffic data.
- Usage statistics for the "Complain to authorities" button. 
- Compile optional user survey data with their thoughts on the project and website.
